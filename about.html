                        In the era of digital advancements, opening a stationery store might sound like an absurd idea
                        to you, however, some markets will never close down in the Indian economy. Pens and papers are
                        still very much in use in schools and offices even in the age of mobile tabs and laptops.
                        Wedding cards and resumes are still preferred to be printed on paper in an old-fashioned way.
                        <br>
                        Also, there is more to stationery than just pens and notebooks, and any stationery shop
                        proprietor would gladly describe the items. If you are someone interested in retail and looking
                        for an avenue to start a business, starting a stationery store would be just the thing for you.
                        While you have the liberty of choosing among a number of products and are at a creative
                        independence in this particular business, don’t get blown away in all directions. Make a
                        structured list of things you want to sell. Think of a particular theme and stick to it while
                        ordering your supplies. Following are a few stationery business ideas:
                        <br>

                        School supplies starting from pens, notebooks, paints, crayons, globes, geometry boxes to office
                        supplies like markers, files, folders, and whiteboards.
                        Card specialist having all possible cards from printing business cards to greeting cards to
                        wedding invitations.
                        Art supplies in detail for all types of paintings—oil, charcoal, stencil, water paints, etc.
                        Craft supplies such as glitter, beads, ribbons, organza, buttons, and wool.
                        General stationery paraphernalia such as scissors, staplers, glue, gift wrappers, and tape.
                        Baking, chocolate making, and stitching kits such as cupcake molds, crochet, and quilling
                        equipment.
                        Party supplies such as balloons, masks, confetti, candles, crowns, and streamers.
                        Computer software and printers, ink cartridges, toners, headphones.
                        <br>
                        As with other business ideas, you need to study the market before you start your business.
                        Figure out who your local competition is and who they cater to. In case of a stationery store,
                        the target market is more or less fixed to children, teenagers, and a few elders whose hobbies
                        may include using stationery. You need to visit your competitor stores and take a look at their
                        products and try to find a gap in the market which can be filled by you. Target all possible
                        markets such as government institutions, hospitals, etc. apart from the regular school and
                        corporate offices.
                        <br>
                        Like any other business, you need funding for your venture. Your start-up budget will need to
                        cover the rent of store premises, supplies, labor charges, and various miscellaneous costs.
                        Create your online stationery store business plan for this purpose stating your business
                        objectives, missions, ownership pattern, objects you wish to sell, and the stationery business
                        start-up costs involved such as store rent, supplies, and employee salaries. Also, give a
                        marketing plan after presenting the market analysis. This would help in getting you the desired
                        loans from banks or investors.
                        <br>
                        In cases such as these, you would have to think of the logistics involved in delivering to
                        individual customers who place an order through your e-commerce site and also delivering
                        supplies for institutional and corporate orders. A significant cost would have to be borne.

                        Another decision which can be made as a retailer is to expand business through a third-party
                        vendor. You can sell your products to other shopping sites such as Flipkart, Myntra, etc. to
                        help extend your reach to customers and also reduce your worry about the logistics.
